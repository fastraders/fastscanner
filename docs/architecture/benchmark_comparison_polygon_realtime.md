# Polygon Realtime Stream Benchmark Report

## Overview

This report documents the current implementation of the Polygon real-time stock aggregation stream integrated with Redis, and presents benchmark results showcasing significant latency improvements.

Performance Optimization
Replaced grouped writes with:

push(..., flush=False) inside handle_messages

A single call to flush() after processing all messages

This reduces round trips and improves Redis write throughput.

Used Local Redis setup instead of Docker image

--- Benchmark Report ---
Handle Calls: 5860
Avg Latency: 0.000300s
Max Latency: 0.002885s


Compared to previous implementation using grouped writes:

Previous latency per 3 symbols: ~0.010s

Previous latency for all symbols: ~0.100s

New latency per message: ~0.0003s

This is a ~33x improvement per message and an order of magnitude reduction for full symbol sets.

This architecture is now capable of handling:

~3,000+ messages/second

With sub-millisecond latency per message
