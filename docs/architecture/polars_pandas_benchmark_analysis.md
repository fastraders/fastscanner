# Polars vs Pandas Benchmark Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance comparison between Polars and Pandas data processing libraries based on comprehensive benchmarking of our FastScanner application workloads. While Polars demonstrates measurable performance improvements, **we recommend maintaining our current Pandas implementation** due to the limited performance gains relative to the significant refactoring effort and learning curve required.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark was conducted using:

- **Test Environment**: 23 processes across 11 CPU cores
- **Sample Size**: 50 samples per process per test case
- **Test Scenarios**: Various time intervals (1min, 2min, 15min, 1h, 5h, 1d) across different data ranges (1D, 1M, 3M, 1Y)
- **Metrics Measured**: Execution time, memory usage, and row processing

## Performance Results

### Speed Performance

- **Average Speed Improvement**: 1.64x faster with Polars
- **Top Speed Improvements**:
  - 5h-1M: 2.46x faster
  - 1min-1Y: 2.40x faster
  - 1d-1Y: 2.21x faster

### Memory Usage

- **Average Memory Difference**: 0.0% (essentially identical)
- **Memory Efficiency**: No significant memory savings observed across all test cases

## Detailed Analysis

### Performance by Data Size

| Scenario | Pandas Time (s) | Polars Time (s) | Speed Ratio | Rows Processed |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1min-1Y  | 0.1574          | 0.0655          | 2.40x       | 202,583        |
| 2min-1Y  | 0.1108          | 0.0544          | 2.04x       | 109,107        |
| 15min-1Y | 0.0590          | 0.0362          | 1.63x       | 15,983         |
| 1h-1Y    | 0.0270          | 0.0196          | 1.38x       | 4,022          |
| 5h-1Y    | 0.0254          | 0.0149          | 1.70x       | 1,007          |
| 1d-1Y    | 0.0115          | 0.0052          | 2.21x       | 252            |

### Key Observations

1. **Larger Datasets Show Better Gains**: The most significant performance improvements occur with larger datasets (1-year ranges), where Polars shows 2.0x+ improvements.

2. **Smaller Datasets Have Minimal Gains**: For smaller time windows and datasets, the performance difference is less pronounced (1.2-1.6x).

3. **Memory Usage Parity**: Both libraries demonstrate identical memory footprints across all test scenarios, indicating no memory optimization benefits.

4. **Consistent Performance Pattern**: Polars consistently outperforms Pandas across all scenarios, but the magnitude varies significantly.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of Switching to Polars

- ✅ **Performance**: 1.64x average speed improvement, up to 2.46x in best cases
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Equivalent memory usage (no regression)
- ✅ **Modern Architecture**: Built with Rust for better performance characteristics

### Costs of Switching to Polars

- ❌ **Refactoring Effort**: Extensive codebase changes required across multiple modules
- ❌ **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn new API and data manipulation patterns
- ❌ **Testing Overhead**: Comprehensive testing required to ensure behavioral equivalence
- ❌ **Ecosystem Maturity**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Pandas
- ❌ **Risk Factor**: Potential for introducing bugs during migration
- ❌ **Maintenance Complexity**: Need to maintain expertise in both libraries during transition

## Decision Rationale

### Why We're Not Switching

1. **Limited Performance Gain**: While 1.64x average improvement sounds significant, the absolute time savings are minimal for our use cases (milliseconds to low seconds range).

2. **High Refactoring Cost**: Our codebase has extensive Pandas integration across:

   - Data processing pipelines
   - Indicator calculations
   - Scanner implementations
   - Adapter layers
   - Test suites

3. **Team Productivity Impact**: The learning curve would temporarily reduce team velocity while developers adapt to Polars' different API patterns.

4. **Risk vs Reward**: The performance gains don't justify the risk of introducing bugs or regressions during a large-scale refactoring effort.

5. **Current Performance Adequacy**: Our existing Pandas implementation meets performance requirements for the FastScanner application.

## Alternative Optimization Strategies

Instead of switching to Polars, we recommend focusing on:

1. **Algorithmic Optimizations**: Review and optimize data processing algorithms
2. **Caching Strategies**: Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Parallel Processing**: Leverage existing multiprocessing capabilities more effectively
4. **Data Structure Optimization**: Use more efficient data structures where appropriate
5. **Selective Adoption**: Consider Polars for specific, performance-critical new features only

## Conclusion

While Polars demonstrates superior performance characteristics with an average 1.64x speed improvement and up to 2.46x gains in specific scenarios, **the decision is made to maintain our current Pandas implementation**. The performance benefits do not justify the significant refactoring effort, learning curve, and associated risks.

The current Pandas-based implementation adequately serves our performance requirements, and the development team's existing expertise ensures continued productivity and maintainability. Future performance optimizations should focus on algorithmic improvements and architectural enhancements rather than wholesale library replacement.
